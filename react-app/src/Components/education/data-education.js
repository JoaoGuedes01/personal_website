This course covers continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), infrastructure as code, microservices, monitoring and logging, and communication and collaboration. Hands-on labs give you experience building and deploying AWS CloudFormation templates and CI/CD pipelines that build and deploy applications on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), serverless applications, and container-based applications. Labs for multi-pipeline workflows and pipelines that deploy to multiple environments are also included."

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) was formed to provide the public with the resources to understand key risks and improve software security. And every few years, they publish a list of the ten biggest application security vulnerabilities. In this course, application security expert Caroline Wong provides an overview of the 2021 OWASP Top 10, presenting information about each vulnerability category, its prevalence, and its impact. Though aimed at IT security professionals and developers, anyone who uses web applications will benefit from an understanding of these risks."
