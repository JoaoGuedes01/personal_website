# Personal Website

## Copyrights Warning (Can I clone this repo?)
This is the Repository for my own Personal Website project. I've been working on it for a while and learned a lot. I'm sharing what I learned with everyone by choosing to make my code public I only ask in return that you do not steal it for your own and be original. If you decide to use my project as a base for your own do not forget to tag this repo anywhere so to give me credit. Thank you :)

### TLDR
Yes you can use my project as long as you give me proper credit for anythign you do with my code and do not steal my work.
