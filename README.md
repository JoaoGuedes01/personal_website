# personal_website
This is the Repository for my own Personal Website project. I've been working on it for a while and learned a lot. I'm sharing what I learned with everyone by choosing to make my code public I only ask in return that you do not steal it for your own and be original. If you decide to use my project as a base for your own do not forget to tag this repo anywhere so to give me credit. Thank you :)
